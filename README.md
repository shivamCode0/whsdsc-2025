**Team Members:** Shivam Gupta, Samhitha Kovi, Ethan Baek  
**Affiliation:** Lambert High School, GA  
**Competition:** [2025 Wharton High School Data Science Competition](https://wsb.wharton.upenn.edu/wharton-data-competition/)  
**Achievement:** ü•á **1st Place Winner** out of 490+ teams from 34 countries

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the **winning methodology** from the 2025 Wharton High School Data Science Competition, where our team "Full Court Analysts" achieved first place among 490+ teams from 34 countries. Our ensemble approach to NCAA women's basketball prediction combines four independent models to produce robust team rankings and win probabilities.

The competition challenged teams to analyze over 5,300 NCAA Division I women's basketball games, and our methodology has been published in the Wharton Sports Analytics Journal.

### Notebooks

1. **[`1_elo_rating_system.ipynb`](1_elo_rating_system.ipynb)** - Generates primary Elo ratings and tournament predictions
2. **[`2_four_factors_analysis.ipynb`](2_four_factors_analysis.ipynb)** - Implements Four Factors ranking and validation
3. **[`3_temporal_logistic.ipynb`](3_temporal_logistic.ipynb)** - Temporal feature engineering and logistic regression
4. **[`4_pagerank_network.ipynb`](4_pagerank_network.ipynb)** - Network-based PageRank team rankings
5. **[`5_visualization_generator.ipynb`](5_visualization_generator.ipynb)** - Creates all figures and analysis plots

## üèÄ Methodology

Our ensemble approach leverages the complementary strengths of four distinct methodologies:

1. **Elo Rating System** (Primary Model) - Dynamic team strength with basketball-specific adjustments
2. **Four Factors Analysis** - Dean Oliver's fundamental basketball metrics
3. **Temporal Logistic Regression** - Captures team evolution throughout the season
4. **PageRank Network Model** - Network-based strength of schedule analysis
